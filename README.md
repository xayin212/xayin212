# Hi, I'm Wenxuan Xie!

I'm a student at RPI, a Electrical Computer System Engineering and Computer Science Dual Major Student. I've worked on a few projects while here with some small teams utilizing both of my backgrounds. I have experience in LTSpice, LogicWorks 5, MatLab, Git, as well as working knowledge in Java, C/C++, Python, MIPS32/64. Currently learning more SystemVerilog.
